In this article we'll talk about installing a Haskell toolchain on your computer.

Installing a Haskell toolchain becomes really easy when you use [Stack](https://haskellstack.org).

### Stack

Stack is a Haskell build tool that is used to build Haskell software, manage package
dependencies and even install the Glorious Haskell Compiler (AKA GHC).

To get started, go ahead and [download Stack](https://haskell-lang.org/get-started).

After installing Stack you'll be able to execute it by running the `stack` command in
your shell. Let's verify we indeed installed Stack correctly:

```
suppi@ubuntu:~$ stack --version
Version 1.1.2, Git revision cebe10e845fed4420b6224d97dcabf20477bbd4b (3646 commits) x86_64
hpack-0.14.0
```

Alright! Looks like it's working!

### Installing GHC

The next thing we might want to do is install the GHC compiler. We can use stack to install
it for us. To do that, all we need to write is:

```
suppi@ubuntu:~$ stack setup
Run from outside a project, using implicit global project config
Using latest snapshot resolver: lts-6.14
Writing implicit global project config file to: /home/suppi/.stack/global-project/stack.yaml
Note: You can change the snapshot via the resolver field there.
Downloaded lts-6.14 build plan.
Populated index cache.
Did not find .cabal file for snaplet-fay-0.3.3.13 with Git SHA of
423420d2e322320fec411d95c2cbd3a2f5c45991
Right Nothing
Did not find .cabal file for rest-snap-0.2.0.1 with Git SHA of

Right Nothing
Did not find .cabal file for aeson-better-errors-0.9.0.1 with Git SHA of
0deb275b4df73c2a7a042d2e7226eb1b23de8846
Right Nothing
Did not find .cabal file for Spock-worker-0.3.0.0 with Git SHA of
dfdf645795042f1dab44aff29564c8ce82a52c8d
Right Nothing
Did not find .cabal file for Spock-digestive-0.2.0.0 with Git SHA of
df169ccab1012421a82bfc5e65d42e406eb9ed63
Right Nothing
stack will use a locally installed GHC
For more information on paths, see 'stack path' and 'stack exec env'
To use this GHC and packages outside of a project, consider using:
stack ghc, stack ghci, stack runghc, or stack exec
```

After that, the you'll be able to run `ghc`, `runghc` and `ghci` anywhere by typing

```
stack exec -- <command>
```

For example:

```
suppi@ubuntu:~$ stack exec -- ghc --version
Run from outside a project, using implicit global project config
Using resolver: lts-6.14 from implicit global project's config file:
/home/suppi/.stack/global-project/stack.yaml
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 7.10.3
```

### Playing with Haskell

Let's try opening `ghci` and writing something

```
suppi@ubuntu:~$ stack exec -- ghci
Run from outside a project, using implicit global project config
Using resolver: lts-6.14 from implicit global project's config file:
/home/suppi/.stack/global-project/stack.yaml
GHCi, version 7.10.3: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Prelude> putStrLn "Hello, Haskell!"
Hello, Haskell!
Prelude> :q
Leaving GHCi.
```

OK! So Stack ran GHCi using the global project configuration.
Stack can manage different dependencies for different projects, so when you are
not in a folder associated with a project, it will use the default configuration.

Next, we write some Haskell code: `putStrLn "Hello, Haskell!"`. GHCi immediately
evaluated and executed it.

After that, we type the `:q` command to leave GHCi.


Here's an example of using `ghc` to compile a Haskell source file
and then running the compiled executable:

```
suppi@ubuntu:~$ cat > Main.hs
module Main where

main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello from Haskell!"
^C
suppi@ubuntu:~$ stack exec -- ghc Main.hs -o HiHaskell
Run from outside a project, using implicit global project config
Using resolver: lts-6.14 from implicit global project's config file:
/home/suppi/.stack/global-project/stack.yaml
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( Main.hs, Main.o )
Linking HiHaskell ...
suppi@ubuntu:~$ ./HiHaskell
Hello from Haskell!
```

We can also just run the file without compiling it using `runghc`:

```
suppi@ubuntu:~$ stack exec -- runghc Main.hs
Run from outside a project, using implicit global project config
Using resolver: lts-6.14 from implicit global project's config file:
/home/suppi/.stack/global-project/stack.yaml
Hello from Haskell!
```

By default, Stack will only use the standard Haskell library called `base`.
If we'd like to use external packages, for example: `http-client`, we can use
the `--package` flag. This flag will download the package specified and its dependencies
the first time, so it may take some time to load, but the next time you will try it,
Stack will use the packages it downloaded the first time.

Here's a short example of running a `GET` request using http-client from GHCi:

```
suppi@ubuntu:~$ stack exec --package http-client -- ghci
Run from outside a project, using implicit global project config
Using resolver: lts-6.14 from implicit global project's config file:

### What's Next

That's it for this guide. There is of course more to learn, but this
should be enough to start learning from different Haskell learning materials
using Stack.

What's next?

1. [Pickup a learning resource](https://haskell-lang.org/documentation). I can recommend [Haskell Programming from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com), but there are more resources available.

2. [Read the Stack documentation](https://haskellstack.org) to learn more about building and managing Haskell programs and libraries using Stack.

3. [Another, more thorough guide to getting started using Stack](http://howistart.org/posts/haskell/1)

4. [How to write great documentation for Haskell code](http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Haskell-Tutorials--a-tutorial/)

5. [An example for a non-trivial Haskell project](https://blog.jle.im/entry/streaming-huffman-compression-in-haskell-part-1-trees.html)

6. [What I Wish I Knew When Learning Haskell](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/) - A really long reference for a lot Haskell related concepts, features and libraries. Also links to other materials by subject


Good luck learning Haskell! I hope you enjoy it!
